# napplet website

The Astro homepage introduces napplets and showcases runnable apps, shells, protocol status, napplet authoring tools, and shell development tools. The original Svelte explainer remains at `/explainer/`. Astro renders the homepage content into static HTML; Svelte hydrates the explainer, while GSAP adds section reveals that respect reduced-motion preferences.

## Develop

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @napplet/web dev
# Or run the website and documentation together:
pnpm dev:site
```

The website runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. During development, `/docs` redirects to the documentation server at `http://localhost:5174/docs/`; run `pnpm dev:site` to start both. Documentation dependency optimization uses the same modern JavaScript target as its production build. Production serves `/docs/` from static files with directory indexes, so the site needs no application server or SPA fallback.

With `pnpm dev:site` running, run `node scripts/check-site-dev.mjs` to verify all three playable apps, homepage rendering, documentation navigation, and hydrated documentation search. Astro commands use separate dependency caches so running type-checks while previewing cannot invalidate lazy player imports.

## Curate

Edit `src/lib/showcase.ts` to change the selected napplets, shells, and developer tools. Keep names, descriptions, source links, and destinations tied to maintained projects. Editorial descriptions are non-normative; protocol status and requirements defer to the living [NIP-5D proposal](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/2303) and [NAPs track](https://github.com/napplet/naps).

Playable entries point to locally mirrored signed manifests and their original artifact bytes. Preserve the publisher's signature and content hashes when adding or refreshing a selection; editing the downloaded HTML invalidates verification. The player verifies each signed manifest and artifact before execution. Its loader derives from the MIT-licensed [napplet.soy source](https://github.com/zeSchlausKwab/napplet-soy); retain the accompanying attribution when changing that implementation. A curated preview is a limited host for these selections, not a claim that the site implements every NAP.

## Verify the deployed artifact

Run from the repository root. Build conformance with its deployment base after the workspace build, since the default build uses a different asset path.

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm type-check
pnpm -r test:unit
pnpm --filter @napplet/web build
pnpm --filter @napplet/docs build
pnpm --filter @napplet/conformance-web build --base=/conformance/
node --test scripts/assemble-site.test.mjs
node scripts/assemble-site.mjs
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm test:spa-onboarding
python3 -m http.server 8099 --directory site
```

With that static server running, use another terminal:

```bash
node scripts/check-links.mjs http://localhost:8099
node scripts/check-showcase.mjs http://localhost:8099
```

The onboarding check starts its own Astro development server and exercises the preserved `/explainer/#start` flow. The showcase check exercises the assembled production site. Inspect desktop and mobile output when changing layout or animation.

## Deployment

`scripts/assemble-site.mjs` is shared by the deployment and link-check workflows. It places the homepage at `/`, the explainer at `/explainer/`, documentation at `/docs/`, and the conformance runtime at `/conformance/`. It checks for social artwork, robots and sitemap files, verifies the installer copies, and rejects conformance HTML built with the wrong base before replacing the previous artifact.

The deployment workflow uploads the resulting `site/` directory to Bunny storage and purges the pull zone. Bunny is the canonical deployment; nsite is an optional mirror. The existing Bunny storage zone, endpoint, password, API key, and pull-zone ID remain GitHub Actions secrets. Website, docs, conformance, lockfile, or assembly changes trigger deployment after merging to `main` and trigger the corresponding pull-request link check. Configure credentials with `scripts/setup-site-secrets.sh`.
